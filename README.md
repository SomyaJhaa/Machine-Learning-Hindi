# Hindi Machine Learning Exploration

Welcome to the Hindi Machine Learning Exploration repository ! This repository contains a collection of tools and techniques for machine learning tasks specifically tailored for the Hindi language. Here's an overview of the work done in this repository

## Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning** : Removing links, emojis, and other non-textual elements to prepare the data for further processing.
- **Stopwords Removal** : Manually creating a stopwords list since there is no available Hindi stopwords library, filtering out common words that do not contribute to the meaning of the text.
- **Stemming**: Manually implementing stemming techniques as there is no inbuilt library for Hindi stemming, normalizing Hindi text data by reducing inflected words to their root forms. This includes manually created prefixes and suffixes to capture variations in word forms.


## Classification
### Implemented Algorithms
- Logistic Regression Utilizing logistic regression for binary classification tasks with Hindi text data.
- Passive Aggression Implementing the passive-aggressive algorithm for online learning in the context of Hindi language classification.
- Naive Bayes Leveraging the Naive Bayes classifier for efficient and effective classification of Hindi text data.
- SVM (Support Vector Machine) Utilizing SVM for classification tasks; although experiencing some errors, efforts are ongoing for resolution.

## Embedding
- Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Implementing the CBOW model for generating word embeddings from Hindi text data.
- Skip-gram Utilizing the skip-gram approach to generate word embeddings, enhancing representation learning for Hindi language.

## Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- TF-IDF Representation Utilizing the TF-IDF weighting scheme to represent Hindi text data, capturing term importance in documents.
